# Cyraft

This is an exercise in implemeting the Raft algorithm, as it could be useful within pycyphal, in order to implement "named topics". The reason why we're interested in supporting "named topics": this could (eventually) be leveraged to allow Cyphal to function as a communication layer between PX4 and ROS. (See [UAVCAN as a middleware for ROS](https://forum.opencyphal.org/t/an-exploratory-study-uavcan-as-a-middleware-for-ros/872))
